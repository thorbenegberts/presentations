## Rules vs. Principles



<blockquote>
Principles can be summed up in one word. Rules can't.
</blockquote>

For instance a principle might be kindness. A rule is "Don't hit your sister." If there's a principle of treating each other kindly then there isn't a need for a rule that says "Don't hit." "Don't hit," only says "Don't hit." Kids do pick up that it doesn't say don't pinch, don't poke until she cries, don't pull hair ...



<blockquote>
Principles set goals. Rules can't.
</blockquote>

A set of rules can never be complete. There is no guarantee that the rules—no matter how distinct and complete they are—will guide us to achieve a certain goal. Rules center around themselves. In contrast principles set up _goals_. Heading towards a goal makes rules redundant and therefore _waste_.



<blockquote>
Rules are inflexible and stop us think by ourselves.
</blockquote>

We are constantly facing _change_. Change brings both opportunity and danger. Rules are too inflexible to deal with change. But people tend to stick to rules and by that fail to make the right decisions. In contrast to that principles will make you think about how to deal with the new situation and pick the best way to keep heading to the goal the principle has set.
